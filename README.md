# Toms-Physics-Projects
A collection of various Physics simulations/projects I've written in VPython using only my knowledge from PHYS172 at Purdue University. I created these primarily to test my knowledge in the class, which resulted in me getting an A (applied knowledge works).

Don't complain if my math is wrong in anything, I wrote these after only one semester of physics. Also some of these may be incomplete.

Enjoy, and maybe these will help you pass PHYS172 because that class is terrible.
